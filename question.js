AWS Config: AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It helps with compliance monitoring and provides a detailed view of resource configurations but is not primarily designed for managing service limit increases.\n\nC. AWS Service Catalog: AWS Service Catalog is a service that allows organizations to create and manage a catalog of approved IT services, including AWS resources. It helps with standardizing and governing resource provisioning within an organization but does not directly address service limit increase requests.\n\nD. AWS Budgets: AWS Budgets is a service that helps you track your AWS costs and usage against predefined budget thresholds. While it provides cost monitoring and alerts, it does not specifically focus on managing service limit increases."
